FOR ARDUINO UNO
* RoadLights:
```
Green LED's for car -> 2, 5
Yellow LED's for car -> 3, 6
Red LED's for car -> 4, 7
Green LED's for pedestrian -> 8, 10
Red LED's for pedestrian -> 9, 11
Button's -> 12, 13
```
* RoadLights_button && RoadLights_oneFunction:
```
Green LED's for car -> 6, 9
Yellow LED's for car -> 5, 8
Red LED's for car -> 4, 7
Green LED's for pedestrian -> 11, 13
Red LED's for pedestrian -> 10, 12
button's -> 2, 3
```
* async_lightsANDbtn-newMillis:
Based on ```attachInterupt``` in arduino IDE. On UNO works only with pins 2 && 3. 
```
LED's -> 4-6
Button -> 3
```
* async_lightsANDbtn-oldMillis:
```
LED's -> 2-4
Button -> 5
```
* pwm:
```
LED's -> 9-11
